All icons collected for my individual project. 

Icons were not able to be uploaded to Moodle, so they have been stored here.

The icons saved here are:
* icons that were collected but not used for the experiment
* icons that were removed due to filtering
* the compressed icons for the image processing
* essential icons that are used in both web applications

Due to the file size limit that can be uploaded to Moodle, the icons that are essential to the functioning of both web applications are stored here. Within both beauty-ranking and timing-experiment, there are folders labelled "icons." These are the icons that are used in the web applications, and must be placed in the correct folder for the web applciations to work. 

For the beauty ranking experiment, the icons folder must be placed in experiment-app/public. 

For the timing experiment, the icons folder must be placed in timing-app/src.
